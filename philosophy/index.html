    <h1 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h1>
<p>There are a lot of properties to consider for layouts, and
design of a layout is subjective in many ways. There is no <em>best</em>
layout. Still, there are layouts that are better than others. There are
also bad layouts. The QWERTY layout fails on most
comparison criteria. To start with, we can define the properties of a
layout that are least subjective.</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">name: QWERTY
layout: qwertyuiop[asdfghjkl;'zxcvbnm,./
score: 1.35
positional_effort: 64.74
alternation: 47.89
text_direction: 50.49
same_hand:
  jumps: 9.66
  same_finger:
    rp: 2.31
    im: 8.77
  adjacent-mrp:
    inward: 3.62
    outward: 4.00
balance: 64.23
  rows: [50.67, 31.41, 17.77]
  fingers: [8.13, 8.18, 19.09, 28.83, 0.00, 0.00, 11.29, 9.02, 12.96, 2.35]
    indices: 40.12
    middles: 28.11
    rings: 21.14
    pinkies: 10.48
</code></pre>
<h2 id="positional-effort">Positional effort</h2>
<p>The letters that are used most frequently, need to be
placed on the easiest keys to type. We use weights for effort
of each key. In <code>kilo</code> you can customize these weights but the defaults
for kilo look something like this:</p>
<p><img alt="weights" src="../images/weights.svg" /></p>
<p>As for placements of the keys, here is a heat map for QWERTY, </p>
<p><img alt="qwerty heat" src="../images/QWERTY.heat.svg" /></p>
<p>and another for Dvorak,</p>
<p><img alt="qwerty heat" src="../images/Dvorak.heat.svg" /></p>
<p>You can clearly see that Dvoark has better placement of the keys.  <code>kilo</code> 
calculates scores for positional effort, better layouts should have less effort scores.</p>
<p><img alt="effort" src="../images/layouts.db.positional_effort.svg" /></p>
<p>NOTE: we can sacrifice a little positional efficiency for the sake of
getting an overall better layout, but not too much.</p>
<h2 id="alternation">Alternation</h2>
<p>Some might argue that high alternation is not necessarily a good
thing and that typing with one hand is as fast, if not faster. Still
distributing the work on both hands must be better. I've experimented with 
lower alternation and the important scores that
matter seem to be proportional to alternation scores. The top 100
alternation layouts seem to outperform others in all respects.</p>
<p><img alt="effort" src="../images/layouts.db.alternation.svg" /></p>
<h2 id="same-hand">Same Hand</h2>
<p>What is left after alternation, which when you go for high alternation
is about 70%, is same hand effort,  Here a few factors need to be considered.</p>
<h3 id="row-jumps">Row Jumps</h3>
<p>Jumps from top to bottom row or from bottom to top
should be minimized since they break the flow of typing and force you to
move your hands from their home position. So you want a small percentage
of the your total effort to be row jumps.</p>
<p><img alt="jumps" src="../images/layouts.db.jumps.svg" /></p>
<h3 id="adjacent-finger-movement">Adjacent finger movement</h3>
<p>Some adjacent finger movements are more difficult than others. The
difficulty increases when it involves the weaker outer fingers of the hand. The
index finger in general is strong enough. Adjacent index with the middle finger
is not a worry, but for the rest of the fingers it matters. There are two types of adjacent
movements. Inward and outward, outward being the one that is more difficult
for most people so we would like to minimize that.</p>
<p><img alt="outward" src="../images/layouts.db.outward.svg" /></p>
<h3 id="same-finger">Same finger</h3>
<p>Same finger for multiple keys also needs to be minimized but again we
can break it into two parts, the Index and middle fingers are probably not a
problem. But we should decide how much weight to give to them. Some layouts might 
choose to mostly minimize for pinky and ring fingers. It is not clear
how much weight to give im fingers, though, so you can experiment with
that.</p>
<p><img alt="same_finger_rp" src="../images/layouts.db.same_finger_rp.svg" /></p>
<p>And here if we want to consider also same index/middle fingers.</p>
<p><img alt="same_finger_both" src="../images/layouts.db.same_finger_both.svg" /></p>
<p>One thing that you will notice is that as you try to minimize one 
factor the others might go up. So you need to make a decision
which factors matter most. The defaults for <code>kilo</code> favor minimizing 
outward and jumps and same rp finger at the same time minimizing
the sum of these 3 factors as a whole but you can change these defaults.</p>
<p><img alt="same hand" src="../images/layouts.db.same_hand_effort.svg" /></p>
<p>And here we also add same index/middle fingers to the score, if
we decide to consider <code>same_im</code>. </p>
<p><img alt="same hand plus" src="../images/layouts.db.same_hand_effort_im.svg" /></p>
<h3 id="other-factors">Other factors</h3>
<p>There are other factors to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less works for pinkies and ring fingers.</li>
<li>Try to layout the letters in the same direction of the language, so T
  H is better than H T, etc.</li>
<li>Programmer layouts: I think this should be done manually by placing
  the characters you need outside the 32 main characters. Programmers
  still have to write documentation and other texts so they can build on
  a layout with the main 32 characters and customize the rest. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-kilo-approach">The <code>kilo</code> approach</h2>
<p>By default kilo calculates statistics for each layouts and assigns 
a score. You can change the weights that control the internal scorer or
write your own. Any
scoring system will depend on your preferences and will be biased is some way.
Sometimes, you might decide to select a layout that is not the highest scoring,
but one that has good characteristics that you would like to see in a layout.</p>
